<b>HOC</b>
<p> A High order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as Reduxâ€™s connect.</p> 
 
<i>const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);</i>

<b>What is the difference between Component and Higher Order Component?</b>
<p>A component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.</p>
